1. History of passwords and challenges

    show complexity to implement a login page (OWASP)

2. Introducing Web Authentication (single diagram)

    - uses an interface to make authenticator
    
3. Browser support


4. List devices supported
    
3. Didn't arrive overnight built on Credentials API, COSE, CBOR

3. We know the why.. what about who and when

4. But wait isn't this just MFA?

5. Registration request in detail

6. Registration Challenge in detail

7. Login request in detail

8. Login response in detail

10. Own implementation
   - How deep to go
   



Code walkthrough

Security risks

    - Using the key in authdata instead of from database
    - Not verifying the signature
    - missing any of the "steps"
    - Show what happens if no registration
